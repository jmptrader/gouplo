Gouplo is a simple & easy-to-use fileserver, written in Go (golang.org), that features a basic login system and a multiple-file upload form.

**features**
* jQuery/Ajax for dynamic form submissions without page reload.
* HTTP Digest Authentication for basic login capability (better than no login).
* Multiple file handling for batch upload jobs (no progress bar).
* Easily configurable with commandline flags (run 'gouplo -help' for more information).
